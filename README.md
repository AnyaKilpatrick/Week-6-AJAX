# Week-6-AJAX

In this assignment, I used the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice.

I chose animals for my theme, but user can make a list to his own liking by adding new buttons.

When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and places them on the page.
When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif will animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it will stop playing.

Above every gif, its rating is displayed (PG, G, so on).

This data is provided by the GIPHY API.

A form at the page takes the value from a user input box and adds it into the topics array.
